                    Here are some bizzare thoughts that sometimes come to my mind to let you get a glimpse into my
                    internal world.

                        Why philosophy?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        Philosophy is not the hollow, abstract, and useless subject for only "the great sages" like
                        Socrates. In fact, it is the most accessible subject for everyone. Intrinsically, everyone is
                        craving to learn philosophy and find meaning in life, especially when they are young. In fact,
                        social media is always transmitting philosophy to you, unbeknownst to you. Learning philosophy
                        is a means to deepen your mind and safeguard you from immature values being ingrained into you.
                        Essentially everyone is learning philosophy when their parents tell them what is good and bad.
                        But the thing is, your parents' ideas are shaped by their own experiences, which invevitably
                        leads to biases. This is why people crave for philosophy/religious texts like the Bible, Quran,
                        and the Tao Te Ching, which are proven by thousands of years of experience, with billions of
                        people as testaments. Philosophy is tool that lets you understand the world and human
                        nature more deeply and how to act to live a life with no regrets.

                        My journey in becoming a Christian.
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        Why is Christianity so popular throughout history, and spreads whereever it goes? Because the
                        patterns described in the Bible are so universal, and always match the patterns seen in the
                        real world. Let me give you an example: why is the cross the divine symbol of Christianity?
                        The cross represents maximal suffering, which is the essential condition of human existence.
                        Here is an example: there is someone who was bullied at school, diagnosed with ASD, his father
                        constantly beated him, and later in life, his first son would die. I just described Elon Musk.
                        When Jesus was heading to his crucifixion, people were mocking him. Similarly, Elon Musk was
                        constantly ridiculed by the media before his success. The biblical stories have so many
                        implications in real life. Throughout my journey in exploring the Bible, I often feel confused
                        the first time I hear the stories. But after encountering an event or hearing something later
                        in life, I would suddenly remember the story and how the event matches the pattern described in
                        the Bible. Then it would make me understand deeper and drive my interests.

                        What does the Chinese proverb "a man loses his horse, a blessing in disguise" mean?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        The proverb describes a situation where a man's horse runs away. The man calmly accepted the
                        loss and calmly said, "Who knows if this is a curse or a blessing?" A few days later, the horse
                        returned, bringing a group of wild horses.<br />I never understood the meaning of this when
                        I was young, as this seems too random and unlikely. However, the more deep a person is, the
                        more he will understand the meaning of this proverb. Let me give you an example: blind people
                        almost always have extrodinary hearing. This could be a rare ability that turns itself into a
                        high-paying job. The thing is, almost all events in life have two sides. The more knowledge a
                        person has, the more he can see events as both a curse and a blessing. There are many examples
                        of this in real life. Life is not a mathmatical formula: you can never possibly know, or
                        measure, what is "good" for you.

                        Why do humans, and not other animals, donimate the Earth?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        Humans dominate the Earth, because we are so much smarter than other animals, of course. But the
                        question is, how did humans evolve to become so smart? <b>It is exactly because we are weak
                        and vulnerable.</b> We don't have the strength of a lion, shells of a turtle, or the teeth of a
                        shark. It is because of our weakness that we change. This is why silicon-based life can
                        never exist. This material is too strong, too stable, and too perfect, which will never allow it
                        to change. <b>Our weakness ended up producing our only strength. It is the imperfection that
                        makes us human.</b>

                        Why are some people so risk-averse?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        If you hadn't had success in the past, your subconscious will think less of yourself. You will
                        become more risk-averse. This is inevitable and innate to human beings. Instead, if you did
                        something impactful, and was rewarded for it, this will create a positive feedback loop, where
                        you feel more confident and more willing to take more risks. So the ultimate message is, when
                        you are doing something, you must ignore distractions such as how much money you can have, your
                        deficiencies, and your confidence in yourself. Then you could start initiating those positive
                        feedback loops.
